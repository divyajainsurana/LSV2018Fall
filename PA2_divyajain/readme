Compilation steps:

Step 1: read blif file
Step 2: use command priosat k 3

k here denotes number of minterms to be printed on screen

Approach:

First we read the network then we convert the circuit into cnf form by using command cnf_DeriveSimple. 


Then we declare the sat variable and solve the SAT problem. 
The outcome is stored in variable satResult. 

If satResult is true then we get it as sat and if it is false then we get it as unsat else undefined. 

After this a exhaustive search(Brute force algorithm) is made to see every minterm like 000, 001, 010......,111 to check whether it is onset or offset.

After obtaining minterms , now we apply Quine-McCluskey Algorithm to find prime implicants.
